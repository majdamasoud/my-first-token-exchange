# My First Token Exchange
This is my first full stack ethereum project where I made a very simple liquidity pool exchange 
that only allows for one liquidity provider, while replicating the Uniswap interface with my own
design scheme. In this project, I learned how to write and test my own smart contracts and create my
own ERC-20 token using Solidity and Hardhat, and connecting it to the frontend using Ethers.js and React.

Will update further
